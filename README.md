# 2014 Battle School Game Design Overview

## What is a game?
- Players
  - Active, make decisions, are invested and potential winners
  - lusory attitude of the players is the "curious state of affairs wherein one adopts rules which require one to employ worse rather than better means for reaching an end."
- Objectives
  - objective is a key element without which the experience loses much of its structure, and our need to work toward the objective is a measure of our involvement in the game.
- Procedures
  - Procedures, the actions or methods of play allowed by the rules, are an important distinction of the experiences we call games. They guide player behavior, creating interactions that would probably never take place outside the authority of the game.
- Rules
  - define game objects, proscribe principles, and limit behavior within the game.
- Resources
  - Finding and managing resources is a key part of many games, whether those resources are cards, weapons, time, units, turns, or terrain.
- Conflict
  - the relationship between the objectives of the players and the rules and procedures limiting and guiding behavior creates conflict, which the players try to resolve in their own favor.
- Boundaries
  - Magic Circle
    - “All play moves and has its beginning within a playground marked off beforehand either materially or ideally . . . the arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the court of justice, etc. are all in form and function playgrounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart.”
- Outcome
  - The outcome of a game differs from the objective in that all players can achieve the objective, but other factors within the system can determine which of them actually win the game.
  - Unlike favorite movies or books, which can remain entertaining even if we already know the ending, games depend on uncertainty of outcome in every play for their dramatic tension.

## Some thoughts from Sid Meier
- Interesting Decisions. This is core. These are basic fundamental pieces of your game. The journey is the process of exploring these decisions. These are very powerful decisions.
- Learning and Progress. Fundamental to the journey. You're constantly progressing: it's fundamental but it's easy to lose track of this! You can't reward and acknowledge and reflect enough in a game. "What value has this last hour of playing been to me?"
- One More Turn: another way of making the journey epic. The idea that the player is leaning forward, anticipating things coming later. You can foreshadow ideas. Let them know cool stuff is happening soon.
- Replayability. If you create a fantastic journey, and the player reaches the end, they realize this is only one segment: epic cubed.
- Double or halve things, don't bother with fine changes


## Quick note about rewards
- Intrinsic vs Extrinsic 
  - Extrinsic includes things like achievements, progress, new content, reputation
  - Intrinsic includes things like surprise, learning, autonomy, discovery
  - Focusing on extrinsic can lead to unwanted and bad behaviors
- Variable vs Regular
  - It seems like variable rewards are more effective than giving people regularly schedule rewards
  - Sooooo much research into the best variable ratio reward schedules
- Providing vs Removing
  - Cup of coffee example


## Physical game design
- Board games!

## Digital game design
- Basic concepts
  - Cameras
  - Game loop

  - Physics
    - Rigidbodies (has physics)
    - Static colliders (no physics)
    - Character controllers (player movement is generally unrealistic)
- Game engines
